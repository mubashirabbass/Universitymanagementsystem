Agriculture and industry remains the hallmark of Faisalabad with a powerful and ever developing thrust in these sectors. Faisalabad International Airport, Faisalabad Dry Port and Industrial Zone linked with the Motorway are facilitating this hub of industrial activities.The historical Clock-Tower with Eight Bazars designed after Union Jack, presents a magnificent example of town planning located in the province of Punjab to the west of Lahore, the provincial capital. With the proper infrastructure, road linkages Faisalabad serves as an example as district, as division and as a city for the developing world. The Faisalabad International cricket and hockey stadiums host international matches. The city has produced great leadership in the fields of politics, commerce, education, health, sports, agriculture, economy, bureaucracy and biotechnology.";

Special conductive environment is to be developed for studies, research and technology transfer efforts. In formulating the policies, input of all sections of community should be kept in view.\nAs a general policy, the university shall attract highly qualified staff (Ph.Ds) and arrange to train the young staff in three ways. Firstly by granting admission to M.Phil / Ph.D programs within the University, secondly, outside the University but within Pakistan and thirdly abroad. Teachers shall be encouraged and arrangements will be made for continuous training through short courses and Post-Doctoral training both within the country and abroad.\nIn recruitment of staff at all levels, principles of suitability cum fitness based on merit should be adhered to. Congenial work environment, cordiality of behavior and incentives for career building should be provided and there should be built in provisions in the system.\nBeing a public sector organization, we have to follow the government rules and also the spirit of the decision of the Supreme Court of Pakistan regarding recruitment. All posts shall be advertised in the National Press with qualification and experience as per approved University Act and Statues of each post. The syndicate approves the recommendations of the Selection Board of the University for BPS-17 through BPS-21 posts and Vice Chancellor approves the recommendations of the appointment committees for BPS-01 through BPS-16 posts.
